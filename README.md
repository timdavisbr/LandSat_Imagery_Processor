# LandSat_Imagery_Processor
This is a tool that takes LandSat Images that are in the tar file format and unzips, and composites all the numbered bands.
## Lots of LandSat Images to Process 
In the pasted this job involved a lot of time, pain, and suffering. Keeping all the files in order and making sure that you didnâ€™t unzip the same file twice was all part of the fun.
